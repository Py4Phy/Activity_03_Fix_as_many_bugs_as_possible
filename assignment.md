## Activity 3 -- Bug hunt!
[![GitHub Classroom Workflow](../../workflows/GitHub%20Classroom%20Workflow/badge.svg?branch=main)](../../actions/workflows/classroom.yml) ![Points badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/points.svg)


Read the comments in each file to understand what the code *ought* to
do. Then **fix the bugs in the files `bug_01.py` to `bug_09.py`** so
that the code *actually* does what it is supposed to be doing...

See
https://py4phy.github.io/PHY432/modules/python/debugging/#activity-fix-as-many-bugs-as-possible
for context.
